# Introduction #

This is a project to develop an opensource solution for the 3CDC of Cincinnati, Ohio to help Administrative Assistants create digital billboards for their companies to display on Fountain Square.   There are over 2,000 digital billboards in the United States but there are few web applications that make use of such technology.

This project will use open source tools such as eclipse, java, apache tomcat to name a few.  The idea is to create something that can be expanded upon later by the community.
